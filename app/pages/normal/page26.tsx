                                    Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students have gone abroad to study
                                    at Western universities since China reopened for business. Now the
                                    flow is starting to reverse, in part due to China's emergence as a
                                    global economic powerhouse and the important role it is set to play
                                    in international affairs in coming years.

                                    The Chinese government has invested heavily in its universities and
                                    encourages foreign students to enroll. In 2010 there were 265,000
                                    foreign students enrolled in Chinese universities, and the government
                                    hopes that figure will reach 500,000 by 2020. Foreign students enroll
                                    independently as local residents, as exchange students from
                                    universities abroad or as travelers or residents taking a few
                                    language or professional growth classes.
